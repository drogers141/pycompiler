<h2>The test Package</h2>
All of the unit tests for the project are in the test package.  Read the documentation for the unittest module 
in the current python documentation for its usage.  unittest is an implementation of the xUnit unit testing 
framework--originally developed by Kent Beck for SmallTalk and most notably implemented for Java with JUnit.
The naming pattern used for modules, classes and methods follows recommendations for the test module in python
that can be used for running regression testing with unit tests.  
<p>
To run any of the test modules, you can right click it and run it as a python run unit test, or you can just run the
module as python--due to the unittest.main() call in the main clause.  Note that in pydev, you can run any open
editor with F9 as well.  For regression testing (ie running all tests) I highly recommend using the Nose testing 
package.  This can be installed with <br>
easy_install nose  <br>
if you have installed setuptools as per the readme in this documentation.  See the Nose website for documentation.
With all of the tests using the naming scheme I have used here, and collected into one directory, you can use
nose to run all the unit tests by cding to the test dir or any dir above it--such the src dir--and executing:<br>
nosetests  <br>
Nose is very powerful and extensible, and also easily runs python's other favorite testing tool, doctest, as well.
If you like using pydev and doing tdd, I am working on a plugin which integrates a test harness that will run
automatically based on modifying target code, as well as other functionality.  This also integrates Nose, at this
point, as a default test harness.
<p>
As far as unit testing techniques go, you should be able to glean a lot from the modules by going through the tests
for a module at the same time as you check out the module.  Note that even now, I would do some things differently based
on learning python more, so all of the code represents a learning process.  Also, you should continually refactor test
code as required--in addition to the target code.  Were I to continue with the project, I would no doubt refactor
much of the test code.  There are a lot of good resources on agile development and tdd that discuss this.  As with all 
the other code, please feel free to extend, fix, improve, etc.
