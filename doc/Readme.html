<h2>PyCompiler</h2>
<ul>
	<li><h3>Overview</h3>
	The PyCompiler project is an implementation of a compiler based on the course work of CS4110 at 
	California State University East Bay (CSUEB), as taught by Prof. James Daley.  It does not have any 
	code generation.  Rather it combines an LL(1) parser, a hastily implemented
	scanner, a virtual machine simulator, a translator that adds translation functionality to the 
	parser, and a tree package that allows creation and viewing of parse trees for any grammar or
	translation scheme that the parser can handle.  The lecture notes related to the compiler/interpreter
	are in the doc/lecture_notes/ directory.  Look there for discussion of anything mentioned in this
	documentation that is not explained.  I refer to the C++ compiler implementation in various places
	as well.  This is discussed in the lecture notes as well, but for a copy, please contact Prof. Daley.
	<p>
	The intent of the project was to help me, Dave Rogers (contact info at bottom), learn more python and 
	practice test-driven development (tdd) using python, while at the same time attempting to generalize the 
	capabilities of the parser/translator/vm compared to their original implementation in C++.  All of the 
	tests for the project are unit tests using the standard python unittest module, and they are collected 
	in the test package.  
	<p>
	Please feel free to add, extend, modify the project as you see fit.  If there are any questions that I
	may be able to help with, my contact info should be at the bottom of each documentation file.
	</li>
	<li><h3>Packages</h3>
	The source code is divided into three packages:
	  <ul>
		<li><a href="pycompiler_package.html">pycompiler_package.html</a></li>
		<li><a href="tree_package.html">tree_package.html</a></li>
		<li><a href="test_package.html">test_package.html</a></li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
</ul>
